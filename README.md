## Courses Portal ##
Courses Portal is a portal made to available a wide variety of courses to students or whoever registers to the portal.
Users can subscribe,unsubscribe,view the cources available to them.

*Courses Portal is a python backend,and is deployed on pythonanywhere.*

to access Courses Portal just go to the URL:
		http://speedy.pythonanywhere.com/Courses_Portal

and you can access this app very easily as the UI used is adding a WOW factor to the app, and many more such UI you can get from web2pylayouts.com.

It is quite a simple site to operate as evrything u need to know is how to analyse the backend python code to see whats going on in the app.

### Functinalities ###
It provides the login interface similar to both the normal user annd the admin, once the admin login he/she will have an extra feature to add new courses to the database,which is absent in normal users.
It provides a user to add,remove,view,thread(ask a topic based questioning to every course),and go to the wikipedia links of the rspective course.
You can also add more admins the thing is that just add manager permission to them.
You can do whatever you want from the above functions.

Can be further improved:-
		When the admin adds any new course, the portal should sends a mail to all the registered users about the new course.Upload and download resources at the view course page.
